NPM - Node Package Manager
    - Worlds bigest code repo npmjs.complex
    - Used to install or initialise packages for use in a Node package or app
    - Packages can be installed locally (within the app/package) or globally (available at system level)

NPX - Node Package Execution
    - Installs, runs and removes a package. Does not add it to package.json
    - Good for one of operations like npx create-react-app <someappname>
